-- Fix: "Students who need attention" listed one pupil out of a class of nine.
--
-- CAUSE: the roster CTE filtered through teacher_roster_student_ids(), which
-- narrows an OPTIONAL subject to the pupils enrolled in it. English Core is
-- flagged is_optional = true on Class 12 Science Non-Medical A with ZERO rows in
-- student_optional_enrollments, so the roster collapsed to a single student and
-- eight children with real warning signs were invisible.
--
-- The portal-adoption and "not using the portal" cards were already moved to the
-- full class roster for exactly this reason; this card was left behind, so the
-- same dashboard reported on two different populations.
--
-- The list now covers every pupil in the classes the teacher is assigned to.
-- That is not a scope widening in any meaningful sense: they are all children
-- this teacher stands in front of. The SIGNALS stay teacher-scoped — the
-- performance band still counts only results in the teacher's own subject, the
-- homework and test signals still count only the teacher's own assignments and
-- exams, and attendance still counts only the teacher's own classes.
