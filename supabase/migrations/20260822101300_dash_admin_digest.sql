-- The dashboard's "This week's insights" digest.
--
-- The blueprint labels this card "AI insights", but every bullet it shows is a
-- threshold observation over data already on the page:
--   "Portal adoption dropped 7pp — 9 students have never logged in"
--   "Mathematics is your weakest subject school-wide at 58%"
--   "Attendance dipped 1.2pp vs last week"
--   "7 classes are more than 2 weeks behind on syllabus pacing"
--
-- So this computes them in SQL rather than asking a model to restate numbers it
-- was handed. Same output, and it is deterministic, explainable, free, instant,
-- and cannot hallucinate a statistic about a real child. The existing
-- generate-principal-ai-insights function is a poor fit besides: it takes its
-- metrics from the CLIENT's request body, so a digest built on it would only be
-- as trustworthy as whatever the browser posted, and it persists nothing.
--
-- Each row is one bullet, ordered most severe first. Rules that do not fire
-- return nothing at all -- a quiet week should read as a short list, not as
-- padding.
